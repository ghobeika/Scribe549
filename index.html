								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>We seek to make any blackboard surface 'smart' allowing a clear recording and transmission of<br />
								the text on a blackboard to a videoscreen or computer. Smartboards are sometimes used today but they have high entry and setup cost. Video cameras area also used but they are imperfect, and professors block text by standing infront of the board. </p>

								<h2>Competitor 1: Smartboards<br /></h2>
								<p>Smartboards are related to our project as they also seek to revolutionize the 'board' in a classroom. Our produt provides less functionality than a smartboard, bugt should be cheaper, and should be able to be installed anywhere, as well as provide our unique video stream featureset. </p>

						<section class="spotlight">
							<div class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<h2>Competitor 2: Cameras<br /></h2>
								<p> Cameras provide similar functionality to our product. We aim to change the way lectures are recorded by giving students an uninhibited view of whats being written on boards, and a clearer focus on the boards in order to provide a more accurate record of lecture.</p>

						<section class="spotlight">
							<div class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<h2>Competitor 3: Tablets and Projectorst<br /></h2>
								<p>Again, this provides a similar functionality to our product, but storing live lectures as videos and recording them is unintuitive. Also, tablets don't provide the 'comfort' of lecturing on a blackboard, we seek to be as unintrusive in the classroom as possible.</p>

								<h2>Competitor 4: Kahn Academy<br /></h2>
								<p>At the end of the day, our products videos will turn out a good deal like a Khan academy video. The main difference is rather than dedicate time alone with a computer to create a video lecture, our product will allow professors do this on the fly by creating the same style product during a live lecture.</p>

								<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
								<p>What we might be using.</p>
							</header>
							<header>
								<h4>Hardware</h4>
								<p>The Sensors we may be using, and how we plan to connect them</p>
							</header>
								<p>We will likely be using microphone and piezo sensors to triangulate chalk position. 
								These sensors can be placed around the chalkboard, and based on the readings from them we should 
								be able to get a sense of whater a touch is occuring on the board.</p>
								<p>Additionally we will be using A2D chips in order to convert the analog data from these sensors into digital signals
								that we can then perform analysis on. A2D chips are relatively cheap, and reliable, so we will likely be looking
								for the best value here when picking our an A2D</p>
								<p>As far as an embedded processor goes, we estimate that we need to handle about 100,000 samples per second and also
								package them and forward the data. Smaller processors would be pushing a limit here, so we are looking towards using an
								Intel Edison, which members of our team already have experience using.  We need basic I/O and general computing here</p>
						    <header>
								<h4>Software and Webtech</h4>
								<p>How we'll transmit the data, package it, and create videos</p>
							</header>
							<p>TCP Sockets will be used as they are standard and easy to set up in any language, also if packets are dropped, there
							 are built in methods to resent data</p>
							 <p> Our server will be written using Django, as a majority of our team is familiar with that framework. In addition to that
							 we will be able to quickly write python applications for testing certain parts of our code, such as live animation drawing.
							 These apps should also be easy to translate for use on the webserver if we use Django to service the app. Django's built in
							 security features will also make making a final webapp with user authentication easier. </p>
							 <p> Our data processing code is what will be responsible for converting raw data into usable data. The outputs of our data 
							 processing should be series of (x,y) coordinates, a label that tells what is otuching the board, and the time that that touch is happening.</p>
							 <p> We will also look into multiple libraries in python to "draw" from coordinates. So far MatPlotlib, and the Turtle Tkinter libraries seem like they may be viable options. To add audio to our lectures we may use moviepy or ffmpeg. We will be analysing which library provides the most favorable results with out product before we pick one. </p>
